<h1>Final Report</h1>
<hr>
<p>In order to amass greater comprehension of my practicum experience, I will include a descriptive paragraph about the nature of the practicum and the supervising organization. Furthermore, I will delineate my position and duties at the site. I will also mention major activities, observations, objective outcomes, challenges, and resolutions that I have conducted, confronted, and achieved.
</p>
<h2>Nature of the practicum & supervising organization </h2>
LCC International University emphasizes a liberal arts education and a commitment to fostering a community of learning. The university attracts students globally and offers programs in various fields, including business administration, psychology, theology, and international relations. My role primarily involved supporting students and professors in natural sciences and psychology courses. 
<h2> On-site duties</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">The placement lasted <b>3.5 months</b>, from September to December. Averagely, I have spent <b>15 hours</b> a week at the placement. I have assisted in <b>instructing</b> some courses, such as Introduction to Natural Sciences, Methods of Inquiry in Natural Sciences, Cognition: Learning, Memory, and Thinking, and Statistics. My responsibilities encompass <b>preparing lab materials, assisting course instructors to lead students in assignments outdoors on the LCC campus, near the sea, near the forest, or in the classroom, taking care of guinea pigs, researching environment-related topics, facilitating class discussions, and leading insightful study sessions</b>. Furthermore, I seized the chance to explore practical tasks, allowing my curiosity to guide the <b>construction of models demonstrating natural phenomena</b>. This hands-on approach enriched my understanding of theoretical concepts and emphasized the significance of curiosity in meaningful learning and practical application in natural science and psychology. These experiences have taught me the value of independent and efficient work, reinforcing my curiosity and determination to progress in the field.
</p>
<br/>
There were two major activities that I carried out at the placement. First, I assisted the instructors to organize an event to raise environment/climate awareness. It required coordinating different departments at the university, such as marketing, admission, student life, and IT, to ensure a smooth operation. Second, I built demo models for natural phenomena, such as atmospheric cells, which took a month to come up with ideas, build the model, run trials, rebuild the model, and present to the class.
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">I have gained both soft skills and hard skills as well as ample of knowledge. Regarding soft skills, the practicum enhanced my communication abilities, time management, organizational thinking, flexibility, and adaptability. First, throughout the practicum, I honed my <b>communication skills</b> in various contexts. Working with professors, students, and different university departments required effective verbal and written communication. Whether facilitating class discussions, coordinating the environment/climate awareness event, or presenting demo models, I developed the ability to <b>convey complex ideas</b> in a clear and accessible manner. Second, the demanding nature of the practicum, with responsibilities ranging from tutoring to event organization and project construction, sharpened my <b>time management skills</b>. Balancing multiple tasks within tight deadlines became a daily challenge. This experience instilled in me the importance of prioritization and efficient time utilization in a professional setting. Third, preparing for lab materials and assisting professors required me to develop the ability to <b>think systematically</b> to anticipate what might be needed, ensuring the most well-rounded class experience for students. Fourth, the dynamic nature of the practicum required a high degree of <b>adaptability and flexibility</b>. From assisting in different courses to engaging in diverse activities, such as outdoor assignments, caring for guinea pigs, and constructing demo models, I learned to adapt to various roles and responsibilities. This adaptability proved crucial in navigating the complexities of an educational environment. 
</p>
<br>
In terms of hard skills, the practicum bridged the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Assisting in courses like Introduction to Natural Sciences, Methods of Inquiry in Natural Sciences, Cognition, and Statistics provided me with a comprehensive understanding of both theoretical concepts and their real-world implications. Engaging in hands-on activities, such as building demo models, enriched my understanding of scientific principles and the importance of curiosity in the learning process. The exposure to diverse teaching methodologies and the opportunity to engage with students in various settings enhanced my pedagogical skills and deepened my understanding of the subjects.
<h2>Challenges and Resolutions</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">During this practicum, the challenge that I have faced the most was to be <b>actively involved</b> in the operation of the site. This occurred due to initial challenges in communicating with the instructors, who understandably had significant work responsibilities. To address this issue, I tried to approach them when they were less occupied to ask about my job and explore ways to further support them. Additionally, I made effort to be attentive and observant, ensuring that the questions I asked directly contributed to my understanding and the rationale behind performing specific tasks.
</p>
    Another challenge arose in <b>setting boundaries</b>. Initially, I was rather lenient with students seeking assistance outside of my work hours. However, over time, I started feeling like they were taking advantage of this flexibility and persistently pushing my boundary to an extent that I could no longer tolerate. Therefore, I kindly asked them to refrain from contacting me after 9 PM because I also have other roles and responsibilities.
<h2>Summary</h2>
In conclusion, the practicum at LCC International University was a transformative experience that not only met but exceeded my initial objectives. The blend of theoretical and practical knowledge, coupled with the development of essential soft skills, has equipped me with a well-rounded foundation for future academic and professional endeavors. This report encapsulates the journey, challenges faced, and accomplishments achieved during this enriching practicum experience.
