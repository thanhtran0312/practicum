        <p class="card-text">I have two objectives. First, to make scientific progress. I would like to contribute to the brain genome project and discover some biomarkers for malignant brain tumors.  Second, to establish a department of neuroscience in Vietnam. We are very underrepresented in academia, and I think it is time to rectify this imbalance. I am finishing my bachelor's program in Psychology at LCC International University in Lithuania. In 2024, I am committed to securing a research internship position to gain hands-on experience before embarking on another academic endeavor. I am also applying to postgraduate programs in Cognitive Neuroscience.

        <h2 id="right">Research Interest</h2>
        <p>The moment that piqued my research interest was during my Cognition class, where we analyzed conflicting eyewitness testimonies related to the tragic case of the killing of a teenage black boy, Mike Brown, by a white police officer, Darren Wilson. Witness accounts varied significantly, raising questions about the influence of implicit biases, attention control, and pre-existing knowledge on perception. The way people perceived identical situations so differently based on the stimuli to which their attention was drawn deeply fascinated me. Therefore, my interests pertain to neural mechanisms underlying visual attentional and perceptual processes. </p>
